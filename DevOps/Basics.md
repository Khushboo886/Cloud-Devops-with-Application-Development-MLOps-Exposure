# WHY DEVOPS?
-> Before DevOps practices became popular, software development and IT operations teams worked in separate silos:\
Developers focused on writing and delivering features.\
Operations teams focused on stability, deployment, and infrastructure.\
Communication between them was limited.\
Releases were slow, risky, and often failed.\
This separation created major challenges in delivering reliable software quickly.\

# How DevOps Solves the Problem?
-> DevOps integrates development and operations using:\
Continuous Integration (CI)\
Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)\
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\
Automated Testing\
Monitoring & Feedback loops\
Collaborative culture

-> This enables:\
Faster releases\
Reduced failures\
Faster recovery from incidents\
Improved reliability\
Better collaboration

# WHAT IS DEVOPS?
-> DevOps is a software development methodology which improves the collaboration between developers and operations team using various automation tools.\
-> These automation tools are implemented using various stages which are a part of the DevOps Lifecycle.
