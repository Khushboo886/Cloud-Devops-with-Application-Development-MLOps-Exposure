# WHAT IS pm2?

-> Can deploy them to multiple servers with zero downtime.\
-> Provies a built in load balancer.

# DISADVANTAGES OF USING TRADITIONAL SYSTEM:
-> In tradtional server, when we run an application and then if we close the terminal then the application is also crashed.\
-> If one project is already running & if we want to start another application, then we have to open multiple cmd terminals.

# HOW TO SET UP pm2?
-> Install node.js. To check if node is installed: node -v\
