1. cp: Copies files or directories from one location to another.
-> Real use case:
Copy a file: cp file.txt backup.txt
Copy file to another folder: cp file.txt /home/khushboo/
Copy a folder (recursive): cp -r folder1 folder2
-> Used for backups, deployments, duplicating configs.
-> Risk (if any): ⚠️ If destination file exists, it may overwrite it.
Safer option: cp -i file.txt backup.txt (-i asks before overwrite)

2. mv: Moves or renames files and directories.
-> Real use case
Rename file: mv old.txt new.txt
-> Move file to another folder: mv file.txt /home/khushboo/
-> Used for organizing files or renaming configs.
-> Risk (if any): ⚠️ If destination file exists, it will overwrite it without warning.
Safer option: mv -i file.txt /home/khushboo/

3. wc (word count): Counts lines, words, and characters in a file.
-> Real use case:
Count lines, words, characters: wc file.txt
Count only lines: wc -l file.txt
Count only words: wc -w file.txt
Count characters: wc -c file.txt
-> Used in Log analysis, Checking file size by line count, Script processing

4. ln: Creates a link between files (a reference to another file).
-> There are two types:
Hard link
Soft link (symbolic link)
-> Real Use Case:
Create Hard Link: ln file.txt file_link.txt
Both files point to the same data.
🔹 Create Soft Link (Most Common): ln -s file.txt shortcut.txt
-> Used for:
Creating shortcuts
Linking configuration files
Managing shared libraries
Example (very common in servers): ln -s /var/log/nginx/access.log access.log
-> Risk (if any)
⚠️ Hard link: If original file is deleted, data still exists (can be confusing).
⚠️ Soft link: If original file is deleted, link becomes broken.
