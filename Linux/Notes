# What is the server?
Server - serve information
Client - Request information

#Diff. b/w Web server & application server
Web server - serves static data
Application server - Serves dynamic data

#Types of Applications
Standalone applications - no requirement of internet database or anything or web browser
web applications - web server which is accessed using a web browser

#Application support - focuses on keeping an application running smoothly in a live (production) environment.

#Application Maintaninance - focuses on improving, updating, and enhancing an application after it has been deployed.

#Introduction To Linux:
1. What is Linux?
-> Open source operating system
-> Introduced in 1991 by Linus Torvalds  
-> Anyone can view the source code
-> Anyone can modify and distribute it
-> It is free to use (in most distributions)

2. How to run Linux:
(a) WSL    (b) Virtual Box    (c) VM on AWS, Azure, GCP    (d) Vagrant

3. Diff. b/w Linux & Windows:
(a) Windows:
-> comes in a commercial license
-> General purpose
-> Have to purchase antivirus

(b) Linux:
-> General Public License
-> mainly focuses on development, networking, terminal, programming, scripting
-> no requirement of antivirus

4. Software Remote location server tools:
-> To connect to and manage a server from another location over a network (LAN or Internet)
(a) RDP - For windows    (b) SSH - For Linux

5. Kernel, Bootloader & Shell
(a) Kernel:
-> Heart of Linux - contains coding files, programs, processes to run Linux
-> Name: Linux Kernel
-> Kernel is mainly in C language so to understand it we use shell

(b) Shell:
-> interface between the user and the kernel.
-> allows you to send commands to the operating system.
-> What Shell Does
(a) Takes user input    (b) Interprets commands    (c) Passes instructions to kernel    (d) Displays output

(c) Bootloader:
-> The process in which the files that are required for starting the OS runs
-> GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) - program that loads the operating system kernel when the computer starts.

6. Desktop Environment: graphical interface layer (windows, icons, menus, panels) that allows users to interact visually with a Linux system instead of using only the command line.

7. System Architecture of Linux:

8. Linux Commands to Get Hardware Information:
(a) top: shows real-time system activity.
(b) df -h: Shows how much disk space is used and how much is free (in GB/MB)
(c) free -h: Shows how much RAM (memory) is used, free, and available in human-readable format (MB/GB).

9. Linux File System
-> Hierarchical structure that starts from a single root directory / and organizes all files and folders under it.
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── usr
├── var
└── tmp

10. Diff. b/w Linux and Unix
(a) Unix:
-> Developed in 1969 at AT&T Bell Labs
-> Key Contributors: Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
-> Owned by vendors
-> Usually paid
-> Used in legacy enterprise systems and specialized servers.
-> Ex: AIX, HP-UX, Solaris

(b) Linux:
-> Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.
-> Open-source and freely distributed.
-> Built to behave like UNIX but not derived from original UNIX code.
-> Most distributions are free
-> Dominates Cloud platforms, Web servers, DevOps environments, Containers (Docker, Kubernetes), Major cloud providers rely heavily on Linux
-> Ex: Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise linux, Desbian

11. States of Processes in Linux:
-> A process is a running program in Linux.
-> During its lifetime, it moves through different states.
* Main Process States:-
(a) New: Process is being created. Not running yet.
(b) Running (R):- Process is actively executing on CPU or ready & waiting for CPU
-> Command:- ps aux
(c) Sleeping (S/D):-
-> S - INterruptible sleep:- wating for some event (line input / output). Can be interrupted.
-> D - Uninterruptible Sleep:- Waiting for hardware (disk / network). Cannot be interrupted.
-> Most processes are usually in sleeping state
(d) Stopped (T):- Process paused manually. Example: Press Ctrl + Z.
(e) Zombie (Z):- Process finished execution. Parent has not collected its exit status
-> It appears as: Z
Zombie processes don’t use CPU, but stay in process table.
