* What is a command?
-> A command is an instruction we give to the terminal to perform any task.

* Commands in Linux:
1. date: To display the date
2. ls: Lists files and folders in the current directory. 
3. mkdir: To make a new directory.
4. ls -l: shows files and directories in long (detailed) format.
5. pwd: Prints the current directory path.
6. touch: To create a new file.
7. clear: to clear the terminal.
8. cd: used to change the directory.
9. cd ..: moves you one directory up (to the parent directory).
-> Ex: If you are in /vagrant/ubuntu/devops then after using cd .., you will get in /vagrant/ubuntu
10. rm: Delete files
11. rmdir: To delete a directory.
12. rm -r: deletes a directory and everything inside it (recursively).
13. cat: displays the file content.

14. echo: Prints text or variables to the terminal.
-> Used to print a message (echo "hello)", check variable value (echo $USER), write text into a file (echo "Hello World" > file.txt), append to a file (echo "New line" >> file.txt)
-> ⚠️ Using > will overwrite the file completely.If the file already contains data, it will be erased.
-> Safer option if you want to keep existing content: >>

15. zcat: Displays the contents of a compressed .gz file without extracting it.
-> Used to view a compressed log file (zcat file.log.gz), to check old system logs (zcat /var/log/syslog.1.gz), to search inside compressed file (zcat file.gz | grep error), very useful in servers where logs are stored in compressed format.
-> ⚠️ No direct risk — it does not modify the file. However, if the file is very large, it may flood your terminal with too much output.

16. head: shows the first 10 lines of a file (by default)
-> Used to quickly preview a file (head file.txt), Show first 5 lines (head -n 5 file.txt), to check the start of a log file

17. tail: Shows the last 10 lines of a file (by default).
-> Used to check recent log entries (tail file.txt), Show last 20 lines (tail -n 20 file.txt), monitor live logs (tail -f file.txt).
-> tail -f keeps running continuously until you stop it (Ctrl + C)

18. less: Opens a file for scrollable viewing (page by page, both forward and backward).
-> Used to view large file safely (less file.txt), used to view log file (less /var/log/messages)
-> Inside less:
↑ ↓ → move line by line
Space → next page
b → previous page
/word → search
q → quit
-> Used heavily in DevOps for reading logs.

19. more: Displays file content page by page, but only forward.
-> Used for simple file viewing.
Space → next page
Enter → next line
q → quit

-> less is an advanced file viewer; more is a simpler, older version for basic page-by-page viewing.
